r2wgames production site

r2wgames is a single page website which serves as the web destination for an all volunteer Indie Game Development and Production Studio. 

Design: 
The target demographic for which the site was designed are gamers. People visiting the studio's facebook page are also encouraged to visit the site. 

The Dream: 
-- Successfully publish a game either on Steam or Android market place. 
-- Create a gaming event like PAX or DGQ which gives back to the community. 
-- Provide those who do not have 'connections' to work with a group of talented artisans and get a taste of what its like to work on a team, located in other parts of the state and with deadlines.
